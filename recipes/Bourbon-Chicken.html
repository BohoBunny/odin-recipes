            This bourbon Chicken uses real bourbon for taste only and chicken thighs to 
            get a more tender meat. If you want a more spicy dish you can add old bay 
            to sub for red pepper flakes and Sriracha sauce. While not required a Wok 
            works best for this kind of dish. If you don't have a wok or dutch oven you can you a 
            large frying pan instead.
